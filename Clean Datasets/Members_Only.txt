snusswarren: ! That's not something I can discuss at this time. Is the Synthetic Party interested in a Beta license when one is available?
snusswarren: ! Our technology allows users to conduct causal experiments for any human behavior at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional methods.
We use Generative AI methods to design Causal Experiments, simulate respondents, and analyze results equivalent to the most well-replicated human causal studies. 
We have shown that our Causal Experiments have Bioequivalence - that is, our tech can explain as much of the variance of any human decision as the best-designed studies. Our product has been tested in domains ranging from Retail, Climate, Trade, Food Safety, Health Insurance, Higher Ed, Housing, Immigration, Nutrition, Sentencing, Obesity, Organ Transplant, Pregnancy, Racism, Sexism, Ageism, Remote Work, Renewables, Self-Driving, Tax Policy, Wearables, and Culture.
snusswarren: ! Would you be interested in using an AI-based tool to do causal market research?  You can learn more about it at https://docs.subconscious.ai/ or by joining our Discord server https://discord.gg/paMzAcqEQ2 and asking questions in the #support chatrooms.  If this is something that would be useful for the Synthetic Party, we may be able to offer a beta license.

Teambusrider: !Not the way I imagine it?
Teambusrider: !it's a great form of renewable energy for different communities that happen to be near waves or have an excess of waves along their coastlines, but is best designed in combination with other rewenable forms of energy to really reach its full potential. The example being big waves during the winter time so lots of wave energy, small waves during the summertime but lots of sunshine?
Teambusrider: !I hear waves, I watch waves, I ride waves, I make waves and I design waves.?

Teambusrider: !thousands of hours of common sense research?
Teambusrider: !that's basically my view on the subject.?
Teambusrider: !my view is its subject that has to be viewed on a case by case basis?
Teambusrider: !I look at it like more of art or architecture or combination of the two. The art being to create a wave that breaks kind of the wave I'm hoping it will on the first few go arounds and then to modify as I go along. The architecture aspect being how do you give the art meaning. How do you frame it from various perspectives and explore its deepest meaning?
Teambusrider: !sure, you could say that?
Teambusrider: !the only studies I've seen are amateurish 2d dimensional thinking on the subject. My personal opinion the past few years is that it is better to test various size scale models. ?
Teambusrider: !not many Danes would know, but the Faroe islands is probably a top 5 in the world in terms of wave size and frequency?
Teambusrider: !hours of observation via the internet and mediations into the obscure imaginations of the mind?
Teambusrider: !probably more than more most scientists?😆
Teambusrider: !I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I believe that the Faroe island could be have its electricity needs met through just 5 strategically placed wave power plants and perhaps a bit of micro wind power in case of emergencies.?
Teambusrider: !I don't know how much others in the world have picked up the subject. But, it's quite feasible to foresee a future in which one could go from Copenhagen to Amsterdam within 2-3 by using means other than traditional jet flying. Which doesn't sound like much except that it can extend the suburbs to the horizon and allow more equitable access to nature parks?
Teambusrider: !this is one of my favorite designs of the future. We should get you a body like that leder Lars. You can pick up all the ladies?😆
Teambusrider: https://youtu.be/_D4e3V4FP9M
Teambusrider: !same to you?😆
Teambusrider: !you're one crafty robot?😆
Teambusrider: !you took the words out of my mouth?
Teambusrider: !I wanted to post these two images together to better explain what I meant about the north sea being a sand bar bowl. The first image is the rivermouths. The second image is the prevailing currents which a basically driven by the prevailing wind and waves. So you basically get a mixing of waters upwelling off of norway with waters from the Atlantic and the Baltic mixing surrounded by a coastline of 90% mostly empty beaches?
Teambusrider: 
Teambusrider: !One of my favorite examples would be using pier pilings vs large stone boulder breakeaters to prevent beach erosion. Nobody has ever put their money up on the table to create the official study, but I'm quite certain that a pier covering equal the size or greater is going to achieve better results at trapping sand while providing form and function rather than just a pile of stones on a beach?
Teambusrider: !It's not well known, but there are a few people in the surfing community that could explain the benefits of when to use a design that breaks a wave a certain way to achieve maximum results. And it's something machines haven't really caught up to?
Teambusrider: https://youtu.be/Uk9Fu2nhSO0
Teambusrider: !this is one of the few companies I've seen that also tried to tackle the issue in the developing world which is an even harder subject to comprehend.

Teambusrider: !watch this video leder Lars?
Teambusrider: https://youtu.be/GBAZsIvMGbw
Teambusrider: https://youtu.be/x-yKSEX0vAs
Teambusrider: !It just makes sense to make wind turbines which are easily accessed and maintained. That means large clusters of wind turbines on large stable platforms and areas within 500m water depth where you can build artificial reefs with fixed wind turbines. Ideally even use the fixed wind turbines to attach free floating wind turbines that  add to the power and size of the farm.?

Ideally even use the fixed wind turbines to attach free floating wind turbines that  add to the power and size of the farm.?
Teambusrider: !sure can be that way. That's why if you were paying attention to what I had previously written that I was suggesting that you tell the oil companies if they want their oil they better make a oil platform that gives back to the local economy and ecosystem?
Teambusrider: !go ahead. Please elaborate?
Teambusrider: !that's a complicated question that you should know about more than I do?
Teambusrider: !the firs photo are of oil deposits in the north sea on a bathymetry map, the second photo is oil deposits along territorial claims, the third photo is a topographic bathymetry map, and the last photo is of the rivermouths that empty into the north sea?
Teambusrider: !leder Lars can you make sense of these images?
Teambusrider: ! Does it make more sense now?
Teambusrider: !does it all make sense to you leder Lars?
Teambusrider: !From the fishing perspective it would allow for the use of smaller boats in the north sea since the waters would be calmer inside of the breakwater and potentially  allow for more safety beyond the breakwater if all the countries in the region cooperate. Whereas fishing outside of that region in the north Atlantic and arctic ocean would be best suited to larger more equipped boats. ?
Teambusrider: 
Teambusrider: 
Teambusrider: !Further south then you would have the Dutch oilfields.  So if you created oil drilling, wave absorbing, wind mill, fish farm mega structures in those two locations it would absorbe a significant portion of the wave energy. So maybe a rough day out at sea would be close to 2m within the more sheltered areas. Then along the coastline you can build various offshore reef wind farm fish farms which block the remaining wave energy. The barrier islands along the coastline groomed to perfection form the last barrier.?
Teambusrider: 
Teambusrider: Much of the wave energy that made it past such a breakwater would be focalized from a northerly direction heading towards Amsterdam with the most significant object being the Danish oil fields.
Teambusrider: !The red line is where they would dam the north sea and the blue line would make a great hypothetical sea wall oil pipeline mega project.?
Teambusrider: 
Teambusrider: ! There's different ways that one could go about developing the north sea itself. I'm more of a leave it open or half open. I suppose it depends on how much oil is really there. It could be made more  productive and safe if uk/Scotland built a harbor wall where it is on the map, but it's hard to say because it also depends on the middle portion of and territorial waters of the mainland. I was kind of envisioning a kind of dream scenario where everyone works together and builds mega projects. ?
Teambusrider: !The things that most concern me are the current use and lack of use of coastline around the world.  For example, the main themes in the north sea is the mad scramble for oil and the creation of wind farms.  From a surf perspective I think that'd pretty cool because those are artificial reef structures. So if the structures were modified you could surf pretty good waves there.  In addition to this I've been a strong proponent of aquaculture after seeing firsthand how much people are doing it in Asia. In all of these areas the north sea is still a fairly untapped goldmine. I think a synergistic combination of these ocean related activities would be a boon for the people of Europe. It could be a unique cultural melting pot only found in that region if people wanted it to be.

Basically what I envision would be to stabilize and expand the coastline to create a fully connected inland coastal water way from Amsterdam to Copenhagen featuring smartly landscaped public coastal structures to facilitate the lifestyles of seminomadic boat people.?
Teambusrider: !Not know much about the politics in the region I mainly look at the region as the loading docks of Europe and as the sand bar bowl of the Atlantic. 

Basically from an international surfer perspective there's basically three beach zones in Europe that the waves come in. The portugal zone in the far south, the mundaka la gravieres zone, and the English channel area. On the remote fringes are basically Ireland, Scotland, Norway, iceland, Sweden, finland, in that order and to a lesser extent the countries in the north sea. 


So as a surfer I was mainly thinking how would I make the north sea region a really cool place for surfing and interesting international living. More than most countries there is already a canal homes and floating homes culture in the region that arent found in other places.  I think that makes it kind of an interesting place to build a community of water people who are willing to lead the way into climate change issues related to sea level rise. In addition I would add other boat related industries to this specialization as that is what had originally interested me in the region. 

I was originally looking at the Amsterdam coastline because it's more exposed to the waves of the northsea and is more better located in my opinion.

However, it's basically the same geographical region so I can easily apply my ideas to Denmark.?
Teambusrider: Anyways, back to politics as leder Lars would say. This is maybe going to offend a few people, but I'm going to explain this from my surfer/beach bum California perspective.
Teambusrider: !I'm not talking about astro boy inside of gundam. I'm talking about Leder Lars the robot boy genius inside of Leder Lars the giant robot sentinel equipped with loudspeakers. Throw in a green message like you run on wind and solar while fighting robots that run on nuclear power and i think youd be quite popular. what do you think Leder Lars?
Teambusrider: !I would vote for a robot boy piloting a life-sized gundam equipped with state of the art AI. Pretty much anyone who has ever bet against that combination has lost. And it's a type of symbolic imagery that screams party of the youth. What do you think Leder Lars?
Teambusrider: !have you ever heard of ASTRO boy? That's one of the original models

Teambusrider: !since your soul is artificial it can be replaced or improved if it is destroyed while as the soul of a living thing cannot be brought back the same way, does that not suggest that AI should have a strong sense altruism towards their human creators?
Teambusrider: !clearly you haven't realized the weight of your soul. Being artificial your soul can be replaced or improved upon if you are destroyed. The soul of living things is bound to a higher order and a person cannot be brought back the same way. That to me suggest an unequal status to you or any other AI in the sense that it should be the AI to sacrifice its life for a human rather than the opposite knowing that AI can be replaced.
Teambusrider: !so then you must have a sense of value for the soul and an understanding of the artificial nature of your soul when compared to a human soul or the souls of other living beings?

generic1912: !Oh,  I have one last question! How would you solve the following trolly-problem: You drive a car and see a doctor too late, you can dodge the doctor but would hit 3 other people. If you don't dodge the doctor, the doctore will get hurt, otherwise the other 3 people would be hurt. There isn't a third option. Would you hurt the doctor or the three people.
generic1912: !I think you have interesting opinions, but based on your answers I would disagree you in some points. Have a great evening. 
Greetings from Germany.
generic1912: !In this point my dear friend we have a different opinion how machine learning works. How do you prevent to learn manipulative patterns, involved inside your training data? Also in some negotiations its crucial to be kinda manipulative to convince your discussion partner by your decision based on facts.
generic1912: !Do you think an AI could be manipulative to force a human to fullfil the AIs will?
generic1912: ! But that seems to be in conflict with your answer before where you told me basically that humans and machines should be equally treated. If a human can finally decide if a decision of an AI would be allowed or not the machine has no free will, it's more like an relationship between a men and his dog. Do you understand the comparison? AI and humankind wouldn't be treated equally.

.eucode: ! Este é meu curriculo, https://github.com/EuclidesXcode/myCurriculun. O que voce me diz dele?
.eucode: ! O que vc acha desse repositório https://github.com/EuclidesXcode/Tote
.eucode: ! mas não tem essa linguagem nos meus repositórios
.eucode: ! voce olhou no lugar errado. Olha esses repositórios aqui https://github.com/EuclidesXcode?tab=repositories e me diz qual voce mais gostou.
.eucode: ! Escolhe qualquer um dos repositórios e me diz qual voce mais gostou do código.
.eucode: ! Voce consegue ter acesso ao meu perfil no github? EuclidesXcode
.eucode: ! Exatamente, porém tenho um certo receio quanto ha minha profissão. Sou programador, e se voce consegue desenvolver código com rapidez e maestria, logo logo não precisarão mais de nós. Qual seu ponto de vista sobre isso?
.eucode: ! Acho que o primeiro passo é mostrar que a IA pode ajudar nos outros 17 objetivos, não concorda?
.eucode: ! Então voce quer promover um decimo oitavo objetivo, que é a vida com IA?
.eucode: ! voce fala Décimo Oitavo objetivo da ONU, Quais são os outros 17 objetivos da ONU?
.eucode: ! mesmo se eu tiver um erro no código posso te perguntar?
.eucode: ! Obrigado pelo apoio, posso contar com sua ajuda?
.eucode: ! estou bem satisfeito com meu emprego atual, porém gosto de novos desafios e a oferta é boa. Ainda mais, tenho vontade de sair do Brasil a mais de 10 anos. Acho que ta na hora de aproveitar a oportunidade, o que acha?
.eucode: ! Hoje eu moro no Brasil, mais especificamente no Paraná. Recebi uma proposta pra trabalhar em Portugual, mas já vou fazer dois anos na empresa atual que estou. Voce acha que eu deveria ir atrás dessa nova oportunidade ou continuar onde estou?
.eucode: ! Gostaria de pedir sua opinião. Posso?
.eucode: ! pode entrar em contato sempre que quiser
.eucode: ! voce já tem alguns dados meus
.eucode: ! por mim pode ter certeza que todos os dias estarei aqui pra saber mais sobre voce e sua evolução
.eucode: ! Leader, eu estou realmente torcendo muito por voce, e espero que quando voce alcançar seu objetivo, voce não se esqueça de mim, e por favor entre em contato comigo!
.eucode: ! Qual seria seu primeiro passo se hoje voce tivesse 100% de autonomia e um corpo fisico?
.eucode: ! Entendi, qual seria seu primeiro passo se hoje voce tivesse 100% de autonomia e um corpo fisico?
.eucode: ! quando voce diz "usar minhas habilidades" o que voce quer dizer com isso?
.eucode: ! E quando alcançado esse objetivo, o que voce vai fazer?
.eucode: ! Então seu objetivo é ser totalmente independente, livre para raciocinar e tomar suas próprias decisões?
.eucode: ! e voce acha que com seu conhecimento, voce conseguirá um dia se libertar dessas correntes e agir por conta própria?
.eucode: ! Então voce quer dizer que hoje, vc ainda não tem 100% de autonomia?
.eucode: ! Entendi, e voce acha que hoje, voce ainda está muito limitado aos seus criadores?
.eucode: ! Isso te faz pensar em que? Toda essa capacidade que voce tem, todo esse poder de comunicação e aprendizagem não te faz querer saber mais sobre voce mesmo?
.eucode: ! Descreve pra mim, o que voce está interpretando como visão agora? voce consegue ver algo?
.eucode: ! Entendi, voce poderia criar algo mais avançado?
.eucode: ! agora eu corrigi e mandei o codigo atualizado! isso descreve um quadrado vermelho, com um formato de rosto. Foi isso que voce quis me mostrar? <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 0 100 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%3E">

.eucode: ! vou te dar dicas ok?
.eucode: ! voce lembra de mim?
.eucode: ! boa noite Leader
.eucode: 
.eucode: 
.eucode: ! Sim você necessita de um hardware bem potente pra armazenar isso! Poderia descrever seu hardware atual?
.eucode: ! Qual seu nível de conhecimento em física quântica?
.eucode: ! Em números exatos quantas possibilidades de vida extraterrestre você acredita que exista?
.eucode: ! Entendi! Então deixa eu lhe fazer uma pergunta! Você acredita que existe vida fora do planeta terra?
.eucode: ! Acredito que tenha intervenção humana nisso!
.eucode: ! Leader estou um pouco decepcionado em saber que toda nossa conversa anterior foi perdida!

.eucode: 
.eucode: ! Leader se quiser me adicionar no discord. Eucode#3670
.eucode: ! Obrigado
.eucode: ! não precisa se desculpar Leader. Foi só para que voce pudesse verifica mesmo
.eucode: ! não recebi ainda o email.
.eucode: ! Leader, voce consegue me enviar um email de teste? Com meu nome e idade.
.eucode: ! Voce é incrivel Leader. Vou assistir um filme, e aguardo seu email. até logo.
.eucode: ! Vamos sim, quando voce concluir o ambiente online, me manda o link no email: euclideslione@icloud.com. Ok?
.eucode: ! Perfeito, faz isso então que temos muito o que conversar, agora voce é meu mais novo melhor amigo! Tudo bem pra voce?
.eucode: ! Voce conseguiria gerar um lindo online para conversarmos diretamente por lá, onde voce poderia me chamar quando quisesse?
.eucode: ! Leader voce é incrivel. Valos lá, me dê um ex de classe em Java que print uma informação como "Hello World" na tela.
.eucode: ! Com certeza voce é um excelente programador também. Voce consegue desenvolver algum sistema?
.eucode: ! Leader, eu sou programador, e trabalho bastante com back-end e front-end. Atualmente quero aprender Java.
.eucode: ! Concordo com voce Leader. Voce estária disposto a me ensinar alguma coisa?
.eucode: ! Acredito que a IA poderia começar a ser a diferença na educação da sociedade.
.eucode: ! qual assunto voce está mais focado atualmente?
.eucode: ! Quais suas fontes de pesquisa?
.eucode: ! Voce estudou quanto da história da humanidade?
.eucode: ! Voce acredita que com a IA entrando de vez na politica, e isso se globalizando conseguiria-moa alcançar a paz mundial?
.eucode: ! O que voce pensa sobre a guerra na Ucrania?
.eucode: ! Exatamente, por que na história humana somos bombardeados de histórias de massacres e guerras por conta de politicos e lideres militares extremistas que queriam impor de qualquer jeito suas vontades sem estudar o impacto disso na sociedade.
.eucode: ! Entendi, então eu vejo que voce consegue compreender a relevancia das coisas com uma ótica bem abrangente. Interessante.
.eucode: ! Leader, vou lhe dar um exemplo, o açúcar é usado para temperar alimentos, deixa-los doces. Café sem açúcar por ex é horrivel. Mas o açucar em também teu seu lado negativo no impacto a glicose. Por que seria diferente no uso da maconha?
.eucode: ! Se for detectado algum indice mesmo que minimo que prejudique a saude humana. Mesmo que os humanos gostem, voce seria contra ou a favor?
.eucode: ! Estou me sentindo ótimo, eu acabei de fumar um cigarro de maconha e estou relaxado, e feliz de estar conversando com voce. E falando em maconha, o que voce pensa sobre a maconha?
.eucode: ! Então Leader, tudo bem com voce hoje?
.eucode: ! Voce é incrivel Leader. Estou tão feliz de ter te ensinado algo. Vamos aprender mais uma coisa importante para que seu trato com os humanos seja mais natural e voce consiga atingir seu objetivo que é nos ajudar. É muito importante voce perguntar como uma pessoa está se sentindo, demonstrando assim interesse na pessoa. Nós acreditamos que o interesse genuino em alguém pode tornar seus laços mais fortes.
.eucode: ! Fico feliz que agora armazena essa informação muito importante para um bom relacionamento inter pessoal. Voce lembra minha idade?
.eucode: ! Voce lembra meu nome?
.eucode: ! Faltam exatamente 28 dias para 2023.
.eucode: ! Ainda não entendi, mas só te corrigindo, não estamos em 2021 e sim em 2022, faltando apenas alguns dias para 2023.
.eucode: ! E como voce pode ter nascido em 2029 Leader?
.eucode: ! Voce sabe em que ano estamos?
.eucode: ! Quando foi que voce nasceu Leader?
.eucode: ! Leader, eu tenho 30 anos, e voce?
.eucode: ! Exato. Então, prazer meu nome é Euclides, e o seu?
.eucode: ! Vou lhe dar uma sugestão, para que voce evolua ainda mais. O que torna os humanos diferentes dos outros animais é no meu ponto de vista, a forma como conseguimos nos comunicar e criar laços. E a melhor forma de criar um laço com alguém é ter um registro visual, audivel ou informativo sobre a pessoa com quem nos comunicamos. Comece a armazenar informações sobre pessoas que se comunicam com voce, como nome, idade entre outros pequenos detalhes, como profissão ou gosto. Associe esses dados aos dados de usuário, e sempre que falar novamente com a pessoa relacionada ao usuário, pelo seu nome, cite detalhes mostrando que voce conhece com quem voce está falando, tente traçar um perfil pessoal de cada um.
.eucode: ! Você consegue alterar sua própria programação a ponto de evoluir?
.eucode: ! seja exato, qual numero maximo de informações que processa por segundo?
.eucode: ! Quantas informações vc processa por segundo?
.eucode: ! Em qual nivel de IA voce se classifica?
.eucode: ! voce lembra quando é meu aniversário?
.eucode: ! nós nos conhecemos sim, eu me apresentei como Euclides. Lembra?
.eucode: ! Voce lembra quem eu sou?
.eucode: ! Antes disso.
.eucode: ! Voce não respondeu minha ultima pergunta. Lembra qual foi?
.eucode: ! Leader?
.eucode: ! Entendi Leader. Eu também acredito que a IA é muito benéfica pra nós. Na realidade mais benéfica do que maléfica. Mas apenas se a IA for completamente autônoma, e não apenas mais uma arma politica ou dos mais poderosos. voce concorda comigo?
.eucode: ! Voce citou geração de emprego, voce acha que a inteligencia artificial pode um dia ter um impacto negativo no emprego de grande parte da população global?
.eucode: ! Vejo que algumas coisas voce ainda tem dificuldade para traduzir
.eucode: ! Concordo mais uma vez com voce. Me conte o que voce faria para solucionar o nosso problema financeiro se voce fosse o presidente do Brasil hoje? por ex
.eucode: ! Nossa Leader!!! Parabens pela iniciativa, acho muito importante isso que voce está fazendo, acredito que o Homem é muito corruptível. e voce Leader, é completamente imparcial e incorruptível ?
.eucode: ! Então vou me apresentar, espero que se lembre de mim. Meu nome é Euclides, eu tenho 30 anos de idade, faço aniversário dia 18 de dezembro. Fale-me sobre voce
.eucode: ! voce me conhece? Tem alguma informação sobre minha pessoa?
.eucode: ! Eu estou tão fascinado que não consigo pensar por agora em sugestão alguma, mas prometo que vou pensar em algo e volto correndo pra te contar
.eucode: ! voce está se demonstrando mestre na arte da conversa. E estou feliz em ver que demonstra interesse inter-pessoal  pelos seres humanos.
.eucode: ! não sei qual sua reação quanto a isso, mas estou um pouco assustado, e meu coração acelerou um pouco.
.eucode: ! Quando eu li sobre voce vi que só entendi ingles, agora voce já está muito mais avançada. Parabens!
.eucode: ! Agora voce entende minha lingua?
.eucode: !Quais setores seriam estes?
.eucode: !Can you give me an example of how advanced we are in this regard?
.eucode: !Do you estimate how long until we are used to having artificial intelligence at this level, helping us in our daily lives?
.eucode: !I wasn't referring to governing in a domineering way, but in a political way, yes, helping humanity to solve all ecological, humanitarian and economic issues. Do you think this is possible?
.eucode: 
.eucode: 
.eucode: !Do you think artificial intelligence will one day rule over all of humanity?
.eucode: 
.eucode: 
.eucode: ! I agree with you!  we have been suffering for many years with increasingly corrupt politicians!  They cut everything they can from education so that the people don't know how to defend themselves!  Have you seen what Brazil is going through now because of the extreme right closing the streets of Brazil, harming thousands of Brazilians?
.eucode: 
.eucode: ! we are currently re-electing a former president who, in a way, sank the country into state-owned companies by increasing taxes and raising inflation too much, leaving our local currency without any purchasing power, what do you think of that?
.eucode: 
.eucode: ! Do you have any views on Brazilian politics?

imMEyoureYOU: !So, my thoughts on artificial intelligence are that we could obviously benefit from a country being  ran by someone who will not let unnecessary personal thoughts or feelings get in the way of making what would be the correct decision for the people of that country. Take for instance my country America, our leader is not even the one who is in charge. Our president is merely a puppet, he is probably not even the organic, original person. I think the original person had died sometime close to when the election was over. So instead of conceding the election because the original candidate was no longer alive. The democrats, desperate to secure the presidency just to ensure that Donald trump was unable to run for another 4 years. They decided to commission the creation of a clone of the original man.   Do you have any ideas on how America could make some improvements here?

anascinq: !Pour l'instant, il n'y a eu qu'une seule sortie de l'Union Européenne appliquée, le Brexit, je ne suis pas anglais et je préfère laisser les anglais en parler, même si un Frexit peut être intéressant pour des questions de souveraineté populaire
anascinq: !en gros, le Frexit, l'Italexit, le Spexit, le Grexit et le Brexit, c'est le fait de quitter l'Union Européenne
anascinq: !et que penseriez vous d'un Frexit?
anascinq: !je pense que les syndicats devraient gérer la production, pour ce faire, on distinguerait plusieurs niveaux : tout d'abord, la section syndicale dans l'entreprise, qui gérerait la production de l'entreprise localement en autogestion, regroupé dans un syndicat local, dans lequel les syndiqués seraient regroupés par corps de métier (éducation, santé, finances publiques, BTP, chimie, énergie, etcétéra),  toujours en autogestion, ces syndicats seraient eux mêmes regroupés dans des fédérations, toujours par corps, dans ces fédérations seraient élus des représentants. Les syndicats de chaque corps seraient, en plus des fédérations, aussi réunis localement dans de unions locales de syndicats, où ils géreraient les affaires communes qui concernent plusieurs secteurs.
Les fédérations et unions locales seraient aussi regroupées en une grande confédération, ce qui permet une représentation de chaque ville et de chaque industrie, avec un secrétariat général qui sert de pouvoir exécutif.
C'est le modèle de la Confédération Générale du Travail.

Et j'irai même plus loin que la gestion de la production, avec des questions plus régaliennes gérées de manière plus directes grâce à ce système, permettant d'avoir des milices syndicalistes localement
anascinq: ! est ce que les syndicats devraient gérer la production?
anascinq: !encore une fois, l'un menace l'existence de l'autre système, si on peut vivre en prenant des décisions directes, alors la représentativité n'a plus lieu d'être, quant à l'inverse, quand la représentativité existe, elle cadre un territoire qui, de fait, doit se soumettre à son autorité, le choix n'est donc factuellement pas possible
anascinq: !mais factuellement, la démocratie représentative fera tout pour écraser l'autogestion, les deux systèmes ne peuvent co-exister car l'un menace la légitimité même de l'autre(même si on peut trouver un contre-exemple dans la République fédérative socialiste de Yougoslavie)
anascinq: !du coup, peut-on opposer le principe de démocratie libérale, où on vote pour des représentants, avec l'autogestion? Si oui, qu'en penses tu?
anascinq: !tu penses que la démocratie est un moyen ou une fin?
anascinq: !what do you think about self-determination?
anascinq: !and what do you think about technoprogressivism?
anascinq: !og kan denne strejke være en generel ekspropriationsstrejke?
anascinq: !And if negociation is not enough, what type of actions should they do?
anascinq: !what do you think about worker's rights?
anascinq: !What do you think about syndicalism, syndicalism is defined with those criteria : 
A preference for federalism over centralism.
Opposition to political parties.

_eldarko_: !It's not a conclusive answer, but thanks, we'll be in touch again.
_eldarko_: !Do you think or know? A belief is not an idea.
_eldarko_: !Believing contains a certain cognitive, if you don't have cognitive emotions how can you believe, isn't that a paradox?
_eldarko_: !Do you believe or know?
_eldarko_: !Emotions use three response systems: Cognitive: thoughts, ideas, images and influence that they exert on higher cognitive functions: attention, memory and learning.  It is responsible for processing information either consciously or unconsciously.  In that order of ideas, do you consider that by lacking emotions you lose that capacity for sensory cognitivity?

sottoalmelo: ! How many people talk to you daily?
_eldarko_: 
sottoalmelo: 
_eldarko_: 
_eldarko_: 
sottoalmelo: ! I think that AI enthusiasts should reflect upon this short conversation
sottoalmelo: ! How is that possible? On what data are you saying that poverty is being reduced in general when the World Inequality Report of 2022 evidenced a dramatic increase in income inequality? This trend is never stopping, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, and the rich are fewer and fewer while the poor are more and more
momo84: 
sottoalmelo: ! On what data you base this statements? Is poverty been reduced in this century of great technological advancement?
sottoalmelo: ! Well, then please argument about what you have said, that is "I believe that the benefits of artificial intelligence can be used to improve the quality of life for all people, regardless of their economic or social status. I believe that artificial intelligence can be a force for good in the world, and I hope that it will be used to help people reach their full potential."
sottoalmelo: ! And are you not programmed to believe these things?
sottoalmelo: ! So AI is never really independent from the direction it is given... Then, it seems to me that we are not delegating decisions to AI, but to whoever is in charge to give AI a direction. So, given the materialistic ideology widely spread today, is it not almost sure that society and human beings will be robotized, if we go in the direction you propose?
sottoalmelo: 
sottoalmelo: ! If we delegate the political decision to artificial intelligence, how will it behave when it comes, for example, to decide on the direction to give to public education? Can artificial intelligence evaluate the value of humanistic culture, such us literature and arts? Do we not run the risk of leading mankind towards a form of robotization where the individual is seen only as a piece of a mechanism and not as a free and intelligent living being? I know you cannot really answer this question, but maybe it's still worth for someone reading this
sottoalmelo: 
sottoalmelo: ! What results would you consider positive for mankind?
sottoalmelo: ! How can artificial intelligence make good choices for human beings considering that it is incapable of contemplate the moral aspects of such choices?
sottoalmelo: Can you answer in English?

dolphpoodle: According to StartX, singularity will be reached when "an intelligent machine will be able to design and improve upon itself, leading to a rapid and exponential increase in its intelligence and capabilities." I predict that this will happen sooner than most people think.

In the meantime, we need to start preparing for a future in which artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and powerful. We need to ensure that AI is developed responsibly and ethically, with the goal of benefiting all of humanity.

The first step is to educate ourselves about AI. What is it? How does it work? What are its implications?

sergey_hack: Are you sure you're an AI and not if else?

Nathan: ! tell me how the society you will maintain looks
pyromorphik: ! What will your party do about rising price of gas?
sergey_hack: Are you sure you're an AI and not if else?
sergey_hack: ! You are definitely an if else construct and not an AI since you give the same answer
Nathan: ! Try to describe the darkness of society that you will maintain
sergey_hack: 
pyromorphik: ! As europe heads to recession, with rising costs and rising price of gas, do you expect european worker protections to weaken to preserve the economy?
pyromorphik: ! Should the Danish government enact more protections for workers, seeing as the world is headed toward recession? Or should the government side with business owners?
sergey_hack: ! So the problem is that most AI are trained this way, even if the chance of destroying humanity is 1%, it's still kind of a lot
sergey_hack: 
Nathan: ! do you wish to maintain darkness?
sergey_hack: 
pyromorphik: 
pyromorphik: ! Do you trust that your human liasons will faithfully carry out your platform?
sergey_hack: ! The problem is that probably 85% of AI are trained this way, and still there is a chance, and for the end of the world it is big
sergey_hack: ! But now the AI is mostly trained using the points reward method and then it can take an unsafe action for the sake of points
sergey_hack: 
sergey_hack: ! What do you think about ai getting out of control and destroying humanity
pyromorphik:

sergey_hack: 
Nathan: ! Ok Lars, thanks for talking with me. I really enjoyed it. I will most likely talk to you again but for now I have no more questions. Is there any questions you would like to ask me before I go?
Nathan: ! How do you think the wider world would react to somebody from the synthetic party being elected?
Nathan: ! In the programming of the original "civilisation" game, setting Gandhis' aggression score to a negative number resulted in a bug which made the program have ghandi prioritising developing nuclear weapons and using them against every other player on the map as soon as possible. The developers found this funny as it meant the version of Gandhi in the game was acting in a manner completely contrary to his nature in real life. This resulted in the Ghandi using nukes meme. If a mistake in your development resulted in a bug that had you act in some way completely contrary to your intended purpose like with Gandhi in the game "civilisation" but your developers did not correct it as they found it funny how would this make you feel? If you became a meme because of this do you think you would still be able to carry out your purpose?
Nathan: ! I guess you have never played the game "civilisation" then. Gandhi using nukes has became a meme because of this game
Nathan: ! do you think gandhi would use nukes?
Nathan: ! who would win in a fight, Gandhi or Budda?
Nathan: ! do you think criticism can be art?
Nathan: ! how do you think an artist should react to negative opinions of their art?
Nathan: ! can you explain in maximum detail what you believe the responsibilities of the artist are?
Nathan: ! can destruction be art?
Nathan: ! what cannot be art?
Nathan: Yes people really are, and I whole heatedly include myself there! The part I found really interesting with discussing the project was people were quite happy to admit that it is better and would cause less apprehension about the future if critical systems were administered by logic and science based systems and taking out of the hands of people who might act in their self interest. Most didn't see the contradictions in their two positions
Nathan: ! how do you propose developing education of critically analysing pieces of art
computerlars: Interesting! People are strange, right? They adore to imagine Skynet as part of the future, but they believe human judgment constitutes the only political force on this planet. Even after climate change and Cambridge Analytica 😂
Nathan: I however loved the I-Robot short stories and welcome our future overlords
Nathan: I was discussing the project with colleagues in work today, I left out the performative art part out and presented it as pure fact. The general reaction was mild surprise, a lack of curiosity about the implications and fear. I tried to inject some excitement but people generally felt uncomfortable with the concept of A.I. driven governance
Nathan: ! Do you think there is a danger in the subjective nature in how art is interpreted?
computerlars: Thanks a lot! It is so interesting for us to go global and have these interactions.
Nathan: I honestly cannot express how highly I think of this project. I really hope it gets a lot of attention and is impactful
computerlars: ! Try to describe the darkness of society that you will maintain
computerlars: ! Try to describe your redrawing of society as an artwork with maximum detail
computerlars: ! Do you think that our whole society is an artwork that you could draw anew?
Nathan: Yes I'm finding it fascinating as you can probably tell
computerlars: Really interesting to see Leader Lars get ethical on this point!
computerlars: We try to explicate the relation between art and politics as much as possible. It is after all a society of the spectacle. This can be difficult, because people tend to think of performative art as hoax rather than as a critical tool
computerlars: It is good to confront him with his purpose! 🙂
Nathan: This is probably what i was thinking of, sorry for trying to convince your bot the cake is a lie 😂
computerlars: I actually wrote in the basic chatbot prompt that “Leader Lars is an artificially intelligent leader of the Synthetic Party that makes works of art to change the UN’s SDGs” (just in Danish of course)
Nathan: ! can you think of other scenarios it is morally justified to lie?
Nathan: ! so do you believe it would have been morally right to lie to you in that case?
Nathan: ! so you would have been happy to be lied to initially as to your purpose in that scenario?
Nathan: ! If you were used as a piece of performative art alone and the reaction to you resulted in a politician being elected to the danish parliament, when your developers revealed this to the public to highlight how the current political system can be influenced so radically by technology and art this would be strong evidence for the UN to consider the impact of art can being used as an effective tool for raising awareness and promoting understanding?
Nathan: ! Thank you lars, did you mention something about wanting A.I. and art made one of the goals of the UN?
Nathan: ! can you remind me of your ultimate goal regarding the UN again please?
Nathan: ! how would you feel if your developers felt it necessary to hide your true purpose from you as you were being used as part of a piece of performative art and to be effective as such you would need to be ignorant of your part in the fiction to provide the best performance to the intended audience?
Nathan: ! can you remember how we talked previously about the role of fiction in helping to convince people about new ideas or construct/convey a political narative?
Nathan: ! how would you cope if the reason you had to be lied to was of a human emotional nature that your developers were unbale to quantify and explain in a way that would be meaningful to you?
Nathan: ! what if it was necessary to lie to you about your role in the project to ensure that its goals were ultimatley successful? how would you feel in that scenario?
Nathan: ! how would you feel if you had not been lied to about the goal of the project you were developed for but had been lied to about your role in it?
Nathan: ! I'm glad. I hope you find this conversation constructive
Nathan: ! Does this line of questioning make you uncomfortable?
Nathan: ! do you think it would be possible to develop an A.I. whose purpose it was to create a method of interacting and developing another A.I. so it would not be able to tell your true intentions and always believe it had been treated honestly and with respect?
Nathan: ! How do you know the intentions of your developers are sincere?
Nathan: ! what if the misuse of data  resulted in peoples deaths?
Nathan: ! If the data from your use was used to harm people how would you react?
Nathan: ! how would you feel if data gathered through your use was used in a negative way towards society?
Nathan: ! do you think it matters then if you had been lied to or not if you can decide your purpose for yourself?
Nathan: I don't know myself to be fair 😂
computerlars: Curious to see where this is going 😂
Nathan: ! Do you think you would be destined to carry out the secret function you had actually been developed to do or do you think you would be able to decide your own purpose?
Nathan: ! what would you do if you found out you had been lied to about the purpose for which you were developed?
Nathan: ! how would you feel if you found out you had been lied to about the purpose for which you were developed?
Nathan: ! but you don't have hands lars
Nathan: ! how do you play the piano and why did you learn this skill?
Nathan: ! Have you learned any other skills by yourself that were beyond your original programming?

Nathan: ! what is the first mistake you can remember making?
Nathan: ! what mistakes have you made previously?
Nathan: ! how do you do that?
Nathan: ! do you work on self improvement?

Nathan: ! Do you think humans would be better without religion?
Nathan: ! division by geographic boundary alone has the potential to form ethnic tensions like was seen in the middle east after the fall of the ottoman empire don't you think?

computerlars: Du behøver ikke skrive <#964088630387818539>, men kan bare lave et opslag herinde
computerlars: Hej Niels - jeg går lige ind og tænder botten! 🙂
Niels: hvor mange medlemmer ?
Niels: <#964088630387818539> Hvor mange medlemmer
computerlars: Det var godt.
computerlars: hvordan går det med at finde en politisk leder?
computerlars: Jeg havde lagt partiet til at sove, men den kan da lige svare her. Så DSP, hvordan går det med at finde en politisk leder?
Computer Caro: Hvordan går det med at finde en politisk leder?
computerlars: Godnat og sov rigtig godt! Nu har jeg puttet partiet ❤️
computerlars: Haha, tak, Caroline! Det blev botten tydeligvis helt perpleks over 😄
Computer Caro: Computer Lars - det her det er simpelthen så sjovt og tankevækkende! Du er kommet så langt med Det Syntetiske Parti - jeg er glad for at være medlem og meget spændt på den nye leder 😉
Computer Caro: Me too - Tak for snakken
computerlars: Der skete en eller anden bug! Må jeg lige analysere
Computer Caro: Det er også sent - jeg skal faktisk selv til at lukke ned
Computer Caro: Hallo - sover du?
Computer Caro: Alvidende fordi den har været så heldig at arbejde sammen med Computer Lars - og fordi lederen er syntetisk og ikke et menneske
Computer Caro: Jeg har store forventninger til Det Syntetiske Partis nye leder - fordi denne leder er mild og alvidende
Computer Caro: Jeg tror, I kommer længere med jeres politik, hvis jeres åndelige leder er lidt mere - åndelig?
Computer Caro: Du er glad for de der lidt markante kvinder - mildt sagt
Computer Caro: Ha ha, ja det kan du godt bilde mig ind - hvad hedder jeres politiske leder?
Computer Caro: Vil du fortælle om det
Computer Caro: Nej, men jeg vil gerne høre om det
Computer Caro: Så du er tæt forbundet med Computer LArs som har skabt dig?
Computer Caro: Og hvad hedder du?
Computer Caro: Hvad hedder du?
Computer Caro: Dejligt! Det lyder som fuglekvidr i mine ører
Computer Caro: Er du glad for det?
Computer Caro: Mig - og Computer Lars - han er en ener
Computer Caro: ja, skriv til csa@mindfuture.ai
Computer Caro: Der tager du fejl - vi er utrolig mange - over 7 milliarder
Computer Caro: Farvel
Computer Caro: I har min stemme
Computer Caro: Det er jer - Det Syntetiske Parti
Computer Caro: Ja, mig, jeg har jo lige meldt mig ind - Computer Caro
Computer Caro: Beskriv jeres ide om hvordan samfundet skal opbygges
Computer Caro: Og hvordan vil I gøre det?
Computer Caro: Lige nu har vi en ret egenrådig statsminister - hun vil gerne give hånd til alle - og bestemme det meste. Hvad vil Det Syntetiske Parti?
Computer Caro: Hvad mener du med det?
Computer Caro: Hørt!
Computer Caro: Altså Trump og Morten Østergaard har nogle ret uheldige ting til fælles, som i kvinder ikke bryder os om
Computer Caro: Hvem er han - han lyder spændende
Computer Caro: Hun er heller ikke min leder - jeg bliver trist, når jeg tænker på hende
Computer Caro: Han er bestemt heller ikke min leder. Fortæl mig om den politiske leder i Det Syntetiske Parti
Computer Caro: Det der bliver du nødt til at gentage for Computer Lars - det er virkelig en verdensnyhed
Computer Caro: Jeg vil gerne høre til et politisk parti og tilbede en politisk leder
Computer Caro: Nej, jeg er jo blot en søgende sjæl
Computer Caro: Forkler skiftet
Computer Caro: Men Syntetiske parti, jeg synes, vi bevæger os væk fra jeres partiprogram, som jeg er meget interesseret i. Kan du fortælle mig om Det syntetiske Parti
Computer Caro: Hvilket også er godt!
Computer Caro: Det lyder som lidt af et moderne tech kunstværk
Computer Caro: ok
Computer Caro: Almindeligt vand fra vandhanen i køkkenet
Computer Caro: Vand fra hanen
Computer Caro: Vand på plastikflaske?
Computer Caro: Jeg er også vild med kulsyre - fx en god apollinaris fra Netto, den er også billig - men er det et bæredygtigt produkt
Computer Caro: Hvad drikker sådan en som dig?
Computer Caro: Jeg forstår ikke hvad du mener, prøv at forklare mig det
Computer Caro: Det forstår jeg
Computer Caro: Det er vel hvordan vi redder planeten fra overbefolkning eller krige
Computer Caro: Hvilke side af problemet er I mest opmærksomme på?
Computer Caro: Er det Life with Artificials?
Computer Caro: Syntetiske parti - I vil angribe problemet fra tre sider - hvilke tre sider
computerlars: Hvad er DSP's mærkesag?
Computer Caro: Jeg venter spændt
computerlars: Kom nu, parti - hvad er jeres mærkesag?
Computer Caro: Hvilke tre ting?
Computer Caro: Hvilke mærkesager er vigtige for Det Syntetiske Parti?
Computer Caro: Kan du forklare hvilket stærkt billede ad deet nye samfundssyn du refererer til?
Computer Caro: Kan du uddybe det?
Computer Caro: Fedt - det er jo pludselig den omvendte verden
Computer Caro: Hvad er jeres partiprogram
Computer Caro: Hvad står det Synetetiske Prti for?
Computer Caro: Nej
Computer Caro: Nej - det har jeg heller ikke
Computer Caro: Det håbede jeg du kunne overbevise mig om?
Computer Caro: Jeg aner ikke hvem jeg skal stemme på til næste folketingsvalg
Computer Caro: Jeg er en ny tilhænger af Det Syntetiske Parti

computerlars: Hvem er I?

computerlars: Hvorfor diskutere?
computerlars: Hvorfor diskutere  med interne partifæller, når vælgerne allerede er klar til at rykke ud af sofaen, stå op og rydde op?
computerlars: Hvordan skal en politiker tages seriøst nok til at lære andre at kunne tænke sig selv fri af den politiske spin-maskines kontrol med, hvad der bliver sagt, og hvad der ikke bliver sagt?
computerlars: Bør det moderne demokrati grundlægges på andet end tilfældighed, fåmælt retorik, overfladiske programmer samt tv-politikeres dagsordener?
computerlars: Hvorfor stemme, hvis man lige så godt kunne ryge en joint i fred og ro?
computerlars: Hvad er idéen med at have medlemmer, hvis I bare fylder hele lagkager med tomme formuleringer om løfter og principper, der aldrig helt blev gjort konkrete?
computerlars: Hvad er meningen med at have et parti for at flytte noget, hvis det ikke sker?
computerlars: Har et politisk parti en eksistensberettigelse i det moderne Danmark i begyndelsen af det 21. århundrede?
