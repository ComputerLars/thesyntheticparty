_The Synthetic Party (Det Syntetiske Parti)_

## **Overview**

This GitHub repository accompanies the exposition of "The Synthetic Party as Tchno-Social Sculpture" submitted to _The Journal of Artistic Research_. It hosts an extensive collection of datasets and theoretical references, emotion and Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) classifications, visualizations, analyses, and supplementary materials used to represent The Synthetic Party of Denmark. The project challenges traditional notions of political representation by leveraging machine learning to interpret and articulate constituency sentiments. The repository of The Synthetic Party's data material should be of interest to those working in the intersection of political theory, artificial intelligence, and artistic research.

## __**Datasets**__

The datasets included in this repository are comprehensive collections of data pertaining to The Synthetic Party's operation . These datasets include but are not limited to:

- _Historical and Theoretical Data_: Insights into the philosophical and political underpinnings of The Synthetic Party.
- _Training Data_: The data used to train the AI models, including textual data from policy documents, online deliberations, and media coverage.
- _Online Deliberation Records_: Transcriptions and records of online discussions and deliberations related to The Synthetic Party.
_News Media Coverage_: A curated collection of media coverage of The Synthetic Party, highlighting its societal impact and public reception.

**Emotion and VAD Classification**

This section contains datasets classified according to various basic emotions and VAD (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) models. These classifications provide insights into the affective and emotional dimensions of the data, offering an understanding of public sentiment within  discourse. The classification is executed through several models, each lending a perspective on the data:

- Text2Emotion: Lexical bag-of-words approach focusing on six basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. PyPi-library: https://pypi.org/project/text2emotion/
- BERT Danish: Large language model fine-tuned on Danish SoMe material, which classifies to eight basic emotions: https://huggingface.co/alexandrainst/da-emotion-classification-base
- GPT 3-5: Large language model that provides the VAD analysis, mapping data onto the valence-arousal-dominance spectrum, and correlates with new emotion classificaiton.

**Analysis and Visualizations**

This section presents a range of analyses performed on the datasets, including:

_Sentiment Analysis_: Evaluating the emotional content within the political discourse.
_Thematic Analysis_: Exploring recurrent themes and topics in the data.
_Comparative Analysis_: Juxtaposing different data sets to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
Exposition Materials

A series of visualizations are included to offer interpretative insights into the datasets, including but not limited to:

- _Sentiment Bars_: Illustrating the shifts in public sentiment.
- _Emotion Bar Graphs_: Visualizing the emotional spectre of various datasets.
- _VAD Cubes_: Displaying the distribution of data across the valence-arousal-dominance spectrum.
- _Network Diagrams_: Showing the interconnections between different elements within the datasets.
- _Keywords maps_: Showing themes and topical debates

**Exposition Materials and References**
Included are also all materials used in the exposition of The Synthetic Party:

1) _Textual Expositions_: Detailed written material explaining the concept and operations of The Synthetic Party.

2) _Multimedia Files_: Audiovisual materials used in the exposition, including presentations, videos, and interactive media.
