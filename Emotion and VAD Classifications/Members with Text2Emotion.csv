"Teambusrider: !The things that most concern me are the current use and lack of use of coastline around the world.  For example, the main themes in the north sea is the mad scramble for oil and the creation of wind farms.  From a surf perspective I think that'd pretty cool because those are artificial reef structures. So if the structures were modified you could surf pretty good waves there.  In addition to this I've been a strong proponent of aquaculture after seeing firsthand how much people are doing it in Asia. In all of these areas the north sea is still a fairly untapped goldmine.
